# Welcome to the Integration DOJO

### Tasks

#### 1 Clone this repository
`git clone git@github.com:theodo/dojo-CSS.git && cd dojo-CSS`

#### 2 Install the project
`yarn start`

#### 3 Go to the DOJO branch
`git co start-branch`

#### 4 Check out the expected design on In-vision
Ask us to invite you on the Invision project to have access to the mocj-up (you'll need to register)

#### 5 Let's go !

The target is to reproduce the design of the mock-up, you already have the start of the project with :
 - 2 react components, Header.js and Card.js with their own stylesheets
 - 1 global stylesheet with some basic fonts / colors
 - the needed API requests to populate your card, from the pokemonList you have, for each pokemon you can access the requested data with : 
    - name : `pokemon.sprites.name`
    - logo : `pokemon.sprites.front_default`
    - types : `pokemon.types[x]type.name, pokemon.types[x+1]type.name` ...
    - id : `pokemon.sprites.id`
 
 You will proceed element by element and follow the advice you got from the quick presentation.
 
 **Don't hesitate to andon if you have any technical or mock-up related question !**
